you need to add a restriction in the number of characters in the name

every task in the app needs to be this structure

{
    taskName : string,
    checkedStatus : false, // default
    taskID : , //a random 4 digit number
}

And then every for every profile I create I must have

{
    username : string,
    userID : ,// a generated random 4 digit number
}

There will be more features once I get the most basic version of the app launched, features like :

- Adding more than one task list
- A funky reward system to reward them for completing tasks.
- Make a built-In pomodro
- Make built-in flashcards and other study techniques

And making myself able to copy that code to my screen timer tracker application that is in the schedule
